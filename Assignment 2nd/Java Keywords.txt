	1) abstract		=	Used to declare an abstract class.
	2) boolean		=	used to declare a variable as a boolean type. It can hold True and False values only.
	3) break		=	Used to break the loop or switch statement.
	4) byte 		=	Used to declare a variable that can hold 8-bit data values.
	5) case			=	used with the switch statements to mark blocks of text.
	6) catch		=	used to catch the exceptions generated by try statements. It must be used after the try block only.
	7) char 		=	used to declare a variable that can hold unsigned 16-bit Unicode characters.
	8) class 		=	used to declare a class.
	9) continue		=	used to continue the loop.
	10) default		=	used to specify the default block of code in a switch statement.
	11)	do			=	used in the control statement to declare a loop. It can iterate a part of the program several times.
	12) double 		=	 used to declare a variable that can hold 64-bit floating-point number.
	13) else		=	used to indicate the alternative branches in an if statement.
	14) enum		=	used to define a fixed set of constants.
	15) extends		=	used to indicate that a class is derived from another class or interface.
	16) final 		=	used to indicate that a variable holds a constant value.
	17) finally		=	indicates a block of code in a try-catch structure.
	18) float 		=	used to declare a variable that can hold a 32-bit floating-point number.
	19) for			=	used to start a for loop. It is used to execute a set of instructions/functions repeatedly when some condition becomes true.
	20) if			=	 tests the condition. It executes the if block if the condition is true.
	21) implements	=	used to implement an interface.
	22) import		=	makes classes and interfaces available and accessible to the current source code.
	23) instanceof	=	used to test whether the object is an instance of the specified class or implements an interface.
	24) int 		=	is used to declare a variable that can hold a 32-bit signed integer.
	25) interface	=	used to declare an interface.
	26) long		=	used to declare a variable that can hold a 64-bit integer.
	27) native		=	 used to specify that a method is implemented in native code using JNI (Java Native Interface).
	28) new 		=	used to create new objects.
	29) null		=	used to indicate that a reference does not refer to anything. It removes the garbage value.
	30) package 	=	used to declare a Java package that includes the classes.
	31) private 	=	is an access modifier. It is used to indicate that a method or variable may be accessed only in the class in which it is declared.
	32) protected	=	is an access modifier. It can be accessible within the package and outside the package but through inheritance only. It can't be applied with the class.
	33) public		=	is an access modifier. It is used to indicate that an item is accessible anywhere. It has the widest scope among all other modifiers.
	34) return		=	used to return from a method when its execution is complete.
	35) short		=	 used to declare a variable that can hold a 16-bit integer.
	36) static		=	used to indicate that a variable or method is a class method.
	37) stirctfp	=	used to restrict the floating-point calculations to ensure portability.
	38) super		=	a reference variable that is used to refer to parent class objects.
	39) switch		=	contains a switch statement that executes code based on test value.
	40) synchronized=	used to specify the critical sections or methods in multithreaded code.
	41) this		=	can be used to refer the current object in a method or constructor.
	42) throw		=	 used to explicitly throw an exception.
	43) throws		=	used to declare an exception.
	44) transient	=	used in serialization.
	45) try			=	used to start a block of code that will be tested for exceptions. 
	46) void 		=	used to specify that a method does not have a return value.
	47) volatile 	=	used to indicate that a variable may change asynchronously.
	48) while		=	used to start a while loop. This loop iterates a part of the program several times.
